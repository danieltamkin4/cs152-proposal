## Title: Premier League Winner Predictions

### Project Description

I will focus on training neural networks (NNs) for the purpose of predicting Premier League soccer games. Two teams that are playing against each other will be looked at, and the NN will predict the winner of the game (none if it is a draw). A new dataset will need to be created, either manually or using an automated process.
The trained NN will be “deployed” as an application by allowing users to input any two teams in the league and testing it against real world results. If all goes well, then an extension of this work will include training the NN to work with international teams, tournaments, and other leagues. Another extension of this work could be to predict the score of a game, rather than the winner. 


### Project Goals

1. Create a dataset of relevant statistics in Premier League games
2. Train a NN that is able to predict a winner when given two teams.
3. Explore methods that will account for injuries and personnel changes.
